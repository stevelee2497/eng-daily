Make Sure You’re Climbing the Right Mountain

A few years ago I watched a friend collapse under the weight of a life that looked perfect from the outside. Top-tier job, corner office, six-figure bonus, designer suits, invitations to every important event. Yet every Sunday night he texted the same thing: “I’m so tired I don’t know how I’ll make it to Friday.” He was sprinting up the corporate ladder at full speed, breaking records, earning applause. The problem? It wasn’t his ladder. It belonged to his father, his classmates, the invisible jury of social media. One day he admitted something heartbreakingly simple: “I don’t even like what I do. I just got really good at something I never cared about.”

That’s the wrong mountain.

Most of us know the feeling. We wake up exhausted not because we worked hard, but because we spent the day (or the year) moving in a direction that doesn’t feel like home. We chase the markers we were told matter: the title, the income bracket, the postcode, the follower count, the body fat percentage, the university our parents can brag about. We measure progress with someone else’s ruler and wonder why the summit never feels like victory.

The right mountain is different for everyone. For one person it’s a quiet garden and a house full of children’s laughter. For another it’s a passport covered in stamps and a bank account that’s usually almost empty. For someone else it’s painting enormous canvases in a freezing studio while eating instant noodles, or running a small bakery that smells like cardamom every morning, or writing code that makes medical devices cheaper in poor countries. The right mountain is the one that makes you forget to check the time. It’s the one where the work itself feels like play often enough that you don’t need a two-week vacation to remember who you are.

Speed is intoxicating because it’s measurable. You can post the promotion, the race time, the revenue graph that keeps going up and to the right. Direction is quieter. You often can’t prove you’re on the right path until years have passed and you realize you’re not burned out, you’re not bitter, you’re not secretly envious of people who chose differently. The evidence shows up as laughter that comes easily, as sleep that doesn’t need medication, as the ability to spend a whole Sunday doing almost nothing and still feel the day was rich.

Climbing slowly up the right mountain beats sprinting up the wrong one for a simple reason: energy is finite. Every ounce poured into a life that isn’t yours is stolen from the life that could have been. The tragedy isn’t failing to reach the top; it’s reaching the top and discovering the view doesn’t move you. By then the people you love have built their lives around your absence, your body has paid compound interest on the stress, and starting over feels impossible.

Pausing to ask “Is this my mountain?” is not weakness; it’s navigation. Sometimes the answer is yes, and you keep climbing with renewed gratitude. Sometimes the answer is no, and the bravest thing you can do is rappel down, dusty and bruised, and walk across the valley to a different slope. That detour is not lost time; it’s the moment the real journey begins.

Choose direction over speed. Move deliberately. Rest when you need to. Take the switchbacks. Celebrate small altitudes instead of obsessing over the summit photo. The right mountain doesn’t demand you arrive quickly; it only asks that you arrive as yourself. When you do, you’ll discover the air is thinner but the joy is thicker, and every slow step feels like coming home.
